DriverPass is a company that provides training and lessons to individuals in the process of becoming licensed drivers. They want to create an application that will assist users in booking reservations and completing tests to prepare them for visiting the DMV. They were hoping to have a cloud based and database integrated application put in place to take care of this from a third party. During this project I was able to speak confidently on the technical requirements for the application. In my current position as a cloud specialist, I deal with companies hoping to take advantage of cloud architecture. This helped me in gathering information from the transcript to piece together a solid plan. However, I would choose to revise my initial use case diagram. I left out a few cases that were quite integral. By implementing as much detail as possible, it would assist me further down the road when additional documents were created from this original one. It was especially important to gather every detail and need from the user, because one small detail could have a chain of changes in different UML documents. They all work in conjunction with one another.  Additionally, when working on a project like this with a team, even if one person understands something that was not put on a diagram, that doesn't mean the next person to review the documents will have any knowledge about this detail that was left out. My approach to designing software has improved since my time here at SNHU. My process lately includes a lot of planning and outlining before writing a single line of code. By utilizing UML diagrams such as Activity and Use case, you can understand a system with a much clearer view, than just by jumping into it.
